# 🚀 T&C PWA Deployment Ready!

> **Note:** Production uses **Railway** for the Node backend (and often the static PWA files too). Netlify steps below are optional if you host the HTML elsewhere.

Your app is now ready for deployment to Netlify + Railway. Here's what I've set up:

## 📁 Files Created/Updated

### ✅ Configuration Files
- `config.js` - Centralized configuration for API URLs and keys
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify deployment configuration
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
- `deploy.sh` - Deployment helper script

### ✅ Updated Files
- `index.html` - Now uses config.js for API URLs
- `admin.html` - Now uses config.js for API URLs
- `admin-integration.js` - Now uses config.js for API URLs

### 1. **Deploy Backend to Railway**
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create new project → Deploy from GitHub
4. Select your repository
5. Railway auto-detects Node.js and deploys
6. Copy your Railway URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)

### 3. **Deploy Frontend to Netlify**
1. Go to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. New site from Git → GitHub
4. Select your repository
5. Deploy (no build command needed)

### 4. **Set Environment Variables**
**In Railway:**
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key`
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_secret`

## 🔗 URLs After Deployment

- **Customer PWA**: `https://your-site.netlify.app`
- **Admin Dashboard**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/admin.html`
